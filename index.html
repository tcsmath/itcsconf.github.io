            <h3>The ITCS Conference</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Theoretical computer science has produced a remarkable wealth of
              beautiful ideas with tremendous impact on computer science and beyond.
              Some of the most powerful contributions, such as P versus NP, pseudo
              randomness, zero-knowledge proofs, PCP, quantum computers, boosting,
              etc, represent not only major technical breakthroughs, but also distill
              fundamental computational concepts and make deep connections between
              different fields and areas. STOC and FOCS played a critical role in
              nurturing these connections when the field was smaller and more
              intimate, by providing a forum where essential new ideas could be
              distilled, rapidly communicated, assimilated, discussed and
              reinterpreted. With the growth of the theoretical computer science and
              the corresponding deluge of information, what is the most effective role
              that a conference can play in facilitating the type of dialog necessary
              for future powerful contributions to the field? The quest of ITCS is to
              embody the answer to this question.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dialog and discussions between sub-areas of ITCS are facilitated by
              organizing ITCS as a single track conference, with "Chair rants" helping
              provide the context for each session. Moreover, submissions, refereeing
              and presentations emphasize the I in ITCS: new concepts or models, new
              lines of inquiry, new techniques or novel use of existing techniques,
              and new connections between areas. Communication is further aided by
              rapid dissemination (four months from submission to conference), and
              free access via electronic proceedings.
